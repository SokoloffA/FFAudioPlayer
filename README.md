# FFAudioPlayer
Framework for the Radiola project

This is an unofficial build of the FFMpeg libraries for macOS. This build was made by me exclusively for my [Radiola program](https://github.com/SokoloffA/radiola)  and is not intended for use in other programs.

If you need FFMpleg libraries use the official builds.
